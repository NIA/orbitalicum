Orbitalicum
===========

It is a...
------------
...homebrew cosmic game and appropriate 2D physics engine in Ruby
made just for fun and no profit.

Also it is my playground for experiments with [RubyGame] lib
and with emulation of orbital movement...

...and a sort-of implementation of my dream to visit space :)

Development preparations
------------------------
In order to play around with code and launch the game, install
the following:

- **Ruby**: follow instructions on [Ruby official site];
- **Rubygems**: again, go to [RubyGems.org] and install as they say;
- *[WIN32]* **RubyInstaller DevKit**: in order to build gem native extensions on Windows, install this as described [here].
- **SDL** and **RubyGame**: as shown in [the guide]
- **V2D** library: `gem install v2d`

Now clone the repo, enter its directory and launch the game:

`ruby orbitalicum.rb`

Have fun :)

Portable installation
---------------------
Sorry, there is none yet :( Even if you want just to play, you should
do all the **Development preparations**. I know that's not cool, and redistributable package is planned but not yet completed.

If you want to make one, feel free to contact me :)
